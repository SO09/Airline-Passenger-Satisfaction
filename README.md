# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the machine learning code and datasets used to predict airline passenger satisfaction. The project utilizes a deep learning model to analyze flight experience data and predict passenger satisfaction levels. This work is based on a challenge from Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction).

## Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to the flight experience of passengers. 

## Performance
The model achieved a test accuracy of 96.02%, with detailed performance metrics including precision, recall, F1-score for both classes:
- Class 0 (Not Satisfied): Precision - 0.95, Recall - 0.98, F1 - 0.97
- Class 1 (Satisfied): Precision - 0.97, Recall - 0.93, F1 - 0.95
